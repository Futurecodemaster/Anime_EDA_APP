# Anime Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Abstract
In this project, I've developed a web application using Streamlit, focusing on the analysis and visualization of a comprehensive anime dataset. My goal is to offer insights into various facets of anime, such as genres, ratings, and airing patterns. This application is designed to be an engaging tool for both anime enthusiasts and data analysts, providing interactive and in-depth exploration of anime data.

## Data Description
My dataset encompasses a wide array of information about anime series and movies. It includes several key columns:
- `MAL_ID`: A unique identifier for each anime.
- `Name`: The title of the anime.
- `Score`: The average rating it received.
- `Genres`: Categories of genres the anime belongs to.
- `Type`: The format, such as TV series or movie.
- `Episodes`: The number of episodes.
- `Aired`: The dates it was aired.
- `Premiered`: The season and year it premiered.
- This rich dataset enables me to perform a comprehensive analysis of trends and preferences in the anime world.

## Algorithm Description
In developing this application, I have utilized various data processing algorithms to organize and analyze the anime data effectively. These include:
- Data filtering and sorting based on different attributes like genre, score, and type.
- Predictive modeling, potentially using RandomForestRegressor, to forecast trends or ratings.
- Sophisticated data visualization techniques to present the data in an accessible and engaging manner.

## Tools Used
For this project, I have employed several tools:
- **Streamlit**: To create the user interface of the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: To generate static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms, if necessary.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations.
- I've also used additional libraries such as `streamlit_lottie` for animations and `requests` for fetching external data.
